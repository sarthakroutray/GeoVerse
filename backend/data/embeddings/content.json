    "content": "S ARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is to provide data products to oceanographic research user community in studies leading to improve our knowledge of the ocean meso-scale variability, thanks to the improvement in spatial and vertical resolution brought by SARAL/AltiKa. Ocean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths within a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow). SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including: Intrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical analyses, modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ... Improvement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large spatial and temporal scales. Contribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream applications. Contribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and space observation data. SARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level (lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics).

    "content": "The tropical belt receives more energy from Sun than it radiates back into space. The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour. Low orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations. In order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is ‘cloud’ and Tropiques in French is ‘tropics’. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform. Megha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and France′s Centre National d′Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earth′s atmosphere. ISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite. CNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare. Megha Tropiques Ground Segment The ground segment is divided into: 1. A satellite operation ground segment providedby India: an S-band telemetry and command station a satellite monitoring and control center 2. A science ground segment including Indian and French parts: an S-band mission station for payload telemetry located in India a mission operation center located in India a level-2 processing center in India such as MOSDAC a level-2 processing center named ICARE in France The Megha-Tropiques satellite is launched by an Indian PSLV launcher in 2011, on a 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20°.",

Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at SAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface.

For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz.

    "content": "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी [UNORDERED LIST: हिन्दी]",

    "content": "VHRR V HRR/2 is a modified version of the VHRR heritage imagers flown on INSAT-2A, -2B, and -2E. The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes: Full frame mode (20° North-South x 20° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk Normal frame mode (14° N-S x 20° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes Sector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5° N-S x 20° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone. The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously. The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).

The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting. RF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min). Note: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders). According to ISRO information, INSAT-3A (launch April 9, 2003) and INSAT-3D (to be launched subsequently), will carry SAS&R and DRT payloads.

    "content": "T he main objective of the Megha-Tropiques mission is to study the convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate. The Megha-Tropiques mission goals are as follows: To provide, simultaneous measurements of several elements of the atmospheric water cycle (water vapour, clouds, condensed water in clouds, precipitation and evaporation), To measure the corresponding radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere, To ensure high temporal sampling in order to characterize the life cycle of the convective systems and to obtain significant statistics. The payloads have swaths of around 1700-200km. It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics. The satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies. The major orbit parameters are: Altitude: 867 km, circular Inclination: 20° Period: 102.16 minutes Repetitivity: 97 orbits in 7 days No. of Orbits Per day: 14 (approx.) [TABLE - Altitude: | 867 km, circular: Inclination: | 20°; Period: | 102.16 minutes; Repetitivity: | 97 orbits in 7 days; No. of Orbits Per day: | 14 (approx.);] [UNORDERED LIST: To provide, simultaneous measurements of several elements of the atmospheric water cycle (water vapour, clouds, condensed water in clouds, precipitation and evaporation), • To measure the corresponding radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere, • To ensure high temporal sampling in order to characterize the life cycle of the convective systems and to obtain significant statistics.]",

Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA) Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) OCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track. Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90 0 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60 0 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days. Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA) ROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.

Data Version Version 1.1 (Beta) Data Sources Altimeter Sensor-Interim Geophysical Data Record (S-IGDR) Indian Ocean Bathymetry Indian Ocean Geoid High resolution coastline Processing Steps i. High resolution bathymetry is used to separate the coastal and land waveforms. ii. Waveforms are classified based on their shape. iii. Waveforms are retracked with the beta parameter retrackers (BETA5 and BETA9) and BAGP (Brown with asymmetric Gaussian Peak) retracker to get sea surface height (SSH), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. iv. Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of &quot; Genetic Algorithm &quot; (Remya et al. 2011) v. Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise. vi. Wind power is calculated using standard wind power formula. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise. References Amarouche L, Thibaut P, Zanife O.-Z, Dumont, P.

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

    "content": "Overview: Welcome to the User Manual for MOSDAC Data Download API ! This tool allows you to download satellite data seamlessly using a simple configuration fileâ€” config.json . Once you have filled out this file correctly according to your download requirements, simply run the script mdapi.py . No need to modify any code! This manual will provide you step-by-step guide to download data though \" MOSDAC Data Download API \". 1. Prerequisites: For running this application, you will need following things: i . Python (Version 3+) ii. Python Library: 'requests' iii. MOSDAC Account credentials (Refer section 5 for ' Authentication ' ) iv. 'datasetId' (Refer section 5 for ' How to find your DatasetId (datasetId) ?' ) Optional Requirement: i. Python Library: 'tqdm' Steps to Install Python Libraries: Requests: i. Check if you have the 'requests' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show requests If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. ii. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install requests This will successfully install the 'requests' module in your system. You can follow the first step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. Tqdm (Optional): iii. Check if you have the 'tqdm' module already installed in your system, by running this on your terminal: pip show tqdm If it is already installed in your system, it will display various details such as version, location, etc. iv. If you don't see any response, then it means that 'requests' is not yet installed in your system. In order to download it, open your terminal and run this: pip install tqdm This will successfully install the 'requests'module in your system. You can follow the previous step again to confirm whether the module has been successfully installed or not. [ Hint : Although not a requirement, installing the Python library - 'tqdm', will provide an enhanced download experience by providing a well-structured 'Progress Bar' while downloading data, providing a clean and visually appealing download process.] 2. How to Download, Install & Run: i. Download 'mdapi' from: https://mosdac.gov.in/software/mdapi.zip ii. Unzip the folder in your desired directory. One will find the following files: a. mdapi.py b. config.json Following is the structure of config.json: { \"user_credentials\": { \"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\" }, \"search_parameters\": { \"datasetId\": \"\", \"startTime\": \"\", \"endTime\": \"\", \"count\": \"\", \"boundingBox\": \"\", \"gId\": \"\" }, \"download_settings\": { \"download_path\": \"\", \"organize_by_date\":false, \"skip_user_prompt\":false, \"generate_error_log\":false, \"error_log_path\": \"\" } } [ Important Tip : Make sure you don't change the name of your Configuration File, i.e. - 'config.json'. Doing so will prevent successful execution of your 'mdapi.py' code, as the name of the Configuration file is already pre-configured inside it.] iii. Edit config.json correctly as per your data requirement, along with your user credentials. ( Refer section: ' Parameter Reference of config.json ' ) iv. In your terminal, run: python mdapi.py v. After fetching the search results, you will see the following message: (If skip_user_prompt is set false ) Do you want to start downloading? (Y/N): vi. Type Y (or Yes) and hit Enter to start the download process. vii. After the Download is complete, you will see a logout message, containing: Download Complete! Logout Successful. Goodbye (your_username) ! [ Background Download : For background downloading set 'skip_user_input' as - true in your 'config.json' file. This will start data download without user interaction.] [ Daily Download Limit : We allow users to download a maximum of 5000 data files per day, per user. If your download exceeds that limit, you will see the message: 'You have reached your Daily Download Quota (5000 per day)' and will be automatically logged out. You will have to wait until the next day if you want to download more data.] 3. Data Download Workflow: Data download workflow includes the following steps to download data through MOSDAC: i. Data Search : Based on the input provided by the user in 'search_parameter' of 'client.json', our application will first fetch the total available files count and their total size. For this, one should know the required 'datasetId'. (Refer section 4 for details) ii. Authentication process : Once the search results are retrieved, if the user provides the input to proceed for download, user authentication takes place. (Refer section 5 for details) iii. Data download : After successful authentication, the data download begins as per user defined configuration. iv . Logout : After completion of the entire process, the user is logged out automatically. 4. Searching data: You don't need to log in to search; an account is only required to download data . If your goal is just to search or preview available datasets using filters like datasetId , startTime , or boundingBox , etc., you can leave the 'user_credentials' blank. No authentication is needed in that case. However, DatasetId is required for search. Following section will guide you how to find your DatasetId: How to Find Your Dataset ID ( datasetId )? In the config.json file, under the search_parameters section, there is a required field called datasetId . This field specifies which dataset you want to download from , and it is mandatory for the application to fetch any data. Where to Find Available Dataset IDs You can explore the available dataset IDs here: Browse datasets : https://mosdac.gov.in/catalog/satellite.php On this page, you can: Browse or filter datasets based on: o Satellite o Sensor o Search Find your desired Product Name (Eg: 3SIMG_L1B_STD, E06OCM_L2C_AD ) , which corresponds to the datasetId you should enter in your config file.

    "content": "SARAL/AltiKa was launched on 25 February 2013 as a joint collaboration mission of ISRO and CNES. With smaller footprint than earlier satellite altimeters, SARAL/AltiKa has improved coastal performance. Specific waveform processing has been used in this product to derive along track geophysical parameters (Sea Surface Height, Significant wave height and wind speed) from the altimeter 40-Hz waveform data. This product is generated for Indian mainland coastal region (up to 50 km from the coast). This product is available for 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa starting from March 2013 through July 2016. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.1 (Beta) Data Sources Altimeter Sensor-Interim Geophysical Data Record (S-IGDR) Indian Ocean Bathymetry Indian Ocean Geoid High resolution coastline Processing Steps i. High resolution bathymetry is used to separate the coastal and land waveforms. ii. Waveforms are classified based on their shape. iii. Waveforms are retracked with the beta parameter retrackers (BETA5 and BETA9) and BAGP (Brown with asymmetric Gaussian Peak) retracker to get sea surface height (SSH), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. iv. Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of &quot; Genetic Algorithm &quot; (Remya et al. 2011) v. Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise. vi. Wind power is calculated using standard wind power formula. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise. References Amarouche L, Thibaut P, Zanife O.-Z, Dumont, P.

For Handbook SARAL/AltiKa: Geophysical Product for Indian Mainland Region (Size: 1.14MB Format: PDF Tool: PDFView) Click Here For value added wave product: The wave power (P) is mathematically derived as Where 1. P is Wave power per unit of wave-crest length (in Kilowatt/m) 2. R represents the satellite range 3. H m0 is the significant wave height (in meters) 4. T is wave period (in seconds) 5. ρ is the density of water (in kilogram/cubic meter) 6. g is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters/square seconds) Wind power is generated by using; We have assumed unit area in this equation. is density of air and is wind speed. Limitations Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.). Geophysical and atmospheric range corrections have been obtained from the standard 1-Hz product of SARAL/AltiKa. Known problems with data Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain). Onboard tracker failure leads to unusable data. Coastal contamination may lead to erroneous estimate of the derived parameters.

    "content": "The Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Lett., 4, 335-343, 2013. Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

    "content": "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी [UNORDERED LIST: हिन्दी]",

    "content": "The oceanic eddy parameter information was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) over Bay of Bengal using AVISO. Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO ftp site ( ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com ) Website ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/ ) Processing Steps Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale. Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered. Known problems with data Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1. Limitations This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator. Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework. isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields. We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach. This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong. The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.

    "content": "T he satellite has 3 payloads: Meteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER Data Relay Transponder (DRT) Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Meteorological Payload The INSAT-3D spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments. IMAGER The INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

OCEANSAT-2 mission is an evolution of the OCEANSAT-1. IRS-P4 (OCEANSAT-I), launched in 1999, is a dedicated satellite for Ocean applications and carries two Payloads: Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) and Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR). Out of these two, OCM is providing valuable data which is used for various applications both within India and by International users. The most significant application areas are identification of Potential Fishery Zones (PFZ) using OCM data & prediction of Monsoon arrival using MSMR data. Experience from OCM data consisted into algorithms developed for atmospheric correction of the data and retrieval of parameters like Chlorophyll concentration, total suspended matter (TSM), estimation of primary productivity, detection of algal blooms. OCEANSAT-2 provides same operational services as OCEANSAT-1 while adding new ones like atmospheric vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity, wind fields over ocean surface, sea state, Ocean dynamics , and bio-physical parameters. OCEANSAT-2 is equipped with three payloads: OCM, Scatterometer and ROSA. OCM was also present on OCEANSAT-I, Scatterometer and ROSA are new instruments. The OCEANSAT-2 data is received at the ISRO Ground Segment, located in Hyderabad, and also at the ASI Multimission National Centre (CNM) , located in Matera.",

    "content": "S ARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc. [UNORDERED LIST: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, • In coastal areas, • For the seasonal forecast, • For the hydrology, • For the climate studies.]",

    "content": "T he MetSat-1 spacecraft was developed by ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), Bangalore. MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle. Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components. MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control). The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters. EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized. The spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.",

    "content": "T he satellite has 3 payloads: Meteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER Data Relay Transponder (DRT) Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Meteorological Payload The INSAT-3DR spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments. IMAGER The INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. The INSAT-3DR Imager payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Imager.

A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. The satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload. So far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication & broadcasting services.",

All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout. हिन्दी [UNORDERED LIST: हिन्दी]",

    "content": "T he satellite has 3 payloads: Meteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER Data Relay Transponder (DRT) Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Meteorological Payload The INSAT-3DS spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments. IMAGER The INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3DS sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.
